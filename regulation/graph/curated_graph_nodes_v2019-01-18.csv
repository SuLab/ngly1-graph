Chemically it is an amide between glucosamine and acetic acid. A single N-acetlyglucosamine moiety linked to serine or threonine residues on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins -O-GlcNAc, is an ubiquitous post-translational protein modification. O-GlcNAc modified proteins are involved in sensing the nutrient status of the surrounding cellular environment and adjusting the activity of cellular proteins accordingly. O-GlcNAc regulates cellular responses to hormones such as insulin, initiates a protective response to stress, modulates a cell's capacity to grow and divide, and regulates gene transcription. In humans, it exists in skin, cartilage and blood vessel as a component of hyaluronic acid, and bone tissue, cornea and aorta as a component of keratan sulfate.",NA

CDG is comprised of phenotypically diverse disorders affecting multiple systems including the central nervous system, muscle function, immunity, endocrine system, and coagulation. The numerous entities in this group are subdivided, based on the synthetic pathway affected, into disorder of protein N-glycosylation, disorder of protein O-glycosylation, disorder of multiple glycosylation, and disorder of glycosphingolipid and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor glycosylation (see these terms).",congenital disorder of glycosylation
