In 12 individuals ages 2 to 21 years with confirmed, biallelic, pathogenic NGLY1 mutations, we identified previously unreported clinical features, including optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone distrophy, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, and lower than predicted resting energy expenditure. Novel findings include low cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) total protein and albumin and unusually high antibody titers toward rubella and/or rubeola following vaccination. We also confirmed and further quantified previously reported findings noting that decreased tear production, transient transaminitis, small feet, a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, and varying degrees of global developmental delay with relatively preserved socialization are the most consistent features.	2016-07-07	presents	disease	clinical feature	NGLY1 deficiency	retinal pigmentary changes	11/11		2017-04-11	http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0169-8159
